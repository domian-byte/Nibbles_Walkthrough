# Nibbles_Walkthrough

This is my first machine on HackTheBox, so don't judge me harshly. I'm doing this for the first time ðŸ˜…

P.S. I used guided mode for this machine

### Task 1: How many open TCP ports are listening on Nibbles?
Used nmap -sT <ip_address> for this.

There are 2 open TCP ports: 80 and 22.

### Task 2: What is the relative path on the webserver to a blog?
To find this, I opened http://<ip_address> in my browser and checked the source code (Ctrl+U).
Web Page:

Source Code:

The /nibbleblog/ directory is the answer.

### Task 3: What content management system (CMS) is being used by the blog?
Went to http://<ip_address>/nibbleblog/ and saw that it's powered by Nibbleblog.

### Task 4: What is the relative path to an XML file that contains the admin username?
I enumerated files using Gobuster:

Found several useful paths and looked through them. Found that /nibbleblog/content/private/users.xml contains the admin username.

### Task 5: What is the admin user's password to log into the blog?

I managed to log in using a common password: nibbles.

Struggled a bit to find the login page. Itâ€™s located at http://<ip_address>/nibbleblog/admin.php.

### Task 6: What version of Nibbleblog is running on the target machine? (Do not include the "v")
Went to "Settings" in the admin panel, scrolled down, and found the version: 4.0.3

### Task 7: What is the 2015 CVE ID for an authenticated code execution by file upload vulnerability in this version of Nibbleblog?
I browsed exploits for Nibbleblog 4.0.3 and found:
CVE-2015-6967

### Task 8: Which user is the Nibbleblog instance running as on the target machine?
To find this out, I needed shell access. I searched for available exploits using Searchsploit, and found one:

Used Metasploit, loaded the exploit:

Set the required options, ran the exploit, and got a shell. Ran whoami â€” I was logged in as nibbler.

### Task 9: Submit the flag located in the nibbler user's home directory.
I was already in the shell, so I just navigated to the home directory and retrieved the flag.

### Task 10: What is the name of the script that nibbler can run as root on Nibbles?
Used sudo -l to find this:

### Task 11: Enter the permission set on monitor.sh (use Linux format like -rw-rw-r--).
Unzipped personal.zip and listed the permissions using ls -l.

### Task 12: Submit the flag located in root's home directory.
I removed the original monitor.sh and created my own monitor.sh file on my host machine with the content bash -i
Then I hosted it and downloaded it onto the victim machine.

Made the file executable and ran it using sudo (since I could run this script as root). This gave me a root shell.

Navigated to /root and opened root.txt.
